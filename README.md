SKILLNEST is a digital learning platform designed to bridge the gap between learners and certified trainers in an online environment. It enables app-approved trainers to create courses, add modules, and assign assessments. Learners can register, explore available courses, view detailed modules, and submit assignments directly through the platform. Submitted assignments are reviewed and evaluated by the respective trainers, ensuring personalized feedback. SKILLNEST aims to tackle common digital learning challenges like lack of motivation, disorganization, and limited interaction by offering a structured, interactive, and supportive educational experience tailored to both learners and trainers.
